        <Strong>Bitcoin jumped briefly on Tuesday after a post on the US markets regulator's X account (formerly Twitter) said it had approved new so-called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the cryptocurrency.</Strong>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Bitcoin">
        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later deleted the post and said its account had been "compromised".

            The social media platform has said the compromised account was not due to a breach of its systems.
            
            US regulators are expected to make an announcement on the new ETFs this week.</p>

        <h2>Inflation in Bitcoin</h2>
        <p>Bitcoin jumped to almost $48,000 (Â£37,800) immediately after the erroneous post before falling back to around $46,000.

            Investors are hotly anticipating an SEC announcement on the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, which is expected this week day</p>


        <h3>Unauthorized Activity</h3>
        <p>"The SEC has determined that there was unauthorized access to and activity on the @SECGov x.com account by an unknown party for a brief period of time shortly after 4 pm ET," an SEC spokesperson told the BBC.

            "That unauthorized access has been terminated," they added. "The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct."</p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1744833049064288387?s=20">Gary Gensler posted a message refuting the erroneous announcement on his personal X account</a>

        <blockquote>"The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products."</blockquote>

        <h2>ETFs Portfolios</h2>
        <p class="lead">Several asset management firms have applied for SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

        <p>ETFs are portfolios that allow investors to bet on multiple assets, without having to buy any themselves.

            Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time.
            
            Some ETFs already contain Bitcoin indirectly - but a spot Bitcoin ETF will buy the cryptocurrency directly, "on the spot", at its current price, throughout the day.</p>
